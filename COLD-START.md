# COLD-START — Marlin DVR TV

## What the app is

Marlin DVR TV is a tvOS app (SwiftUI) that will be a client of the Marlin DVR server — a Go DVR server running as a Docker container on Unraid at http://192.168.1.250:8090/ , source repo git@github.com:marlin1111ai/marlin-dvr.git . Pass 1 (2026-09-05) created the empty Xcode project and the plumbing only. No app features are written.

## Where things live

- This folder: `~/Xcode/Marlin DVR TV` — the Xcode project, the notebook (this file, DECISIONS.md, reports/), and the git repo. The only writable tree.
- Repo: `git@github.com:marlin1111ai/marlin-dvr-tv.git` (branch `main`).
- Server reference clone: `~/Xcode/marlin-dvr-reference` — a read-only clone of marlin-dvr. Never edited, never pushed, never run from.
- Server URL: http://192.168.1.250:8090/ (Marlin DVR on Unraid). Not touched by this project's tooling.

## The rules

- Recon before build.
- Scope lock: nothing not named in a pass's steps gets built or changed; anything extra goes in the report as a question.
- No installs without owner authorization.
- Separate push gate for code the owner tests.
- Nothing force-pushed, ever.
- No secrets in the repo, logs, or reports.
- The server repo is read-only reference; server changes, if ever needed, are raised as decisions for the marlin-dvr project.
- Do not touch: the other folders under `~/Xcode`, the Marlin DVR server and its data, the Unraid host 192.168.1.250, marlinpc 192.168.1.245, the HDHomeRun 192.168.1.105, the UNAS4Pro share.

## How to build

- Open `Marlin DVR TV.xcodeproj` in Xcode and press ⌘B.
- Or from the command line:

```
xcodebuild -project "Marlin DVR TV.xcodeproj" -scheme "Marlin DVR TV" -destination 'generic/platform=tvOS Simulator' build
```

  On this Mac (as of 2026-09-05) that line fails with "tvOS 26.5 is not installed" because the tvOS platform component (simulator runtime and device support) has not been downloaded in Xcode > Settings > Components. Until it is, this form builds the same target against the simulator SDK and reports BUILD SUCCEEDED:

```
xcodebuild -project "Marlin DVR TV.xcodeproj" -target "Marlin DVR TV" -sdk appletvsimulator -configuration Debug build
```

## What is built

The empty project — Pass 1 was plumbing. One app entry point (`Marlin_DVR_TVApp.swift`) and one `ContentView` showing the app name.

## What is NOT built

The app.

## Open questions

None yet. (Environment questions from Pass 1 are listed in `reports/2026-09-05-pass1-plumbing.md`.)

## Next step

Recon of what the app needs from the server.
