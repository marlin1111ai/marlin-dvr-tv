# COLD-START — Marlin DVR TV

## What the app is

Marlin DVR TV is a tvOS app (SwiftUI) that will be a client of the Marlin DVR server — a Go DVR server running as a Docker container on Unraid at http://192.168.1.250:8090/ , source repo git@github.com:marlin1111ai/marlin-dvr.git . Pass 1 (2026-09-05) created the empty Xcode project and the plumbing only. No app features are written.

## Where things live

- This folder: `~/Xcode/Marlin DVR TV` — the Xcode project, the notebook (this file, DECISIONS.md, reports/), and the git repo. The only writable tree.
- Repo: `git@github.com:marlin1111ai/marlin-dvr-tv.git` (branch `main`).
- Server reference clone: `~/Xcode/marlin-dvr-reference` — a read-only clone of marlin-dvr. Never edited, never pushed, never run from.
- Server URL: http://192.168.1.250:8090/ (Marlin DVR on Unraid). Not touched by this project's tooling.
- Approved design: `design/` — the Claude Design export (`Marlin DVR TV.dc.html`, Nocturne design system, `ATV-DVR.zip`). Read-only; never edited. The screens are built to it (DECISIONS.md, 2026-09-05 (design)).

## The rules

- Recon before build.
- Scope lock: nothing not named in a pass's steps gets built or changed; anything extra goes in the report as a question.
- No installs without owner authorization.
- Separate push gate for code the owner tests.
- Nothing force-pushed, ever.
- No secrets in the repo, logs, or reports.
- The server repo is read-only reference; server changes, if ever needed, are raised as decisions for the marlin-dvr project.
- Do not touch: the other folders under `~/Xcode`, the Marlin DVR server and its data, the Unraid host 192.168.1.250, marlinpc 192.168.1.245, the HDHomeRun 192.168.1.105, the UNAS4Pro share.

## How to build

- Open `Marlin DVR TV.xcodeproj` in Xcode and press ⌘B.
- Or from the command line:

```
xcodebuild -project "Marlin DVR TV.xcodeproj" -scheme "Marlin DVR TV" -destination 'generic/platform=tvOS Simulator' build
```

  The tvOS 26.5 platform component (simulator runtime and device support) is installed on this Mac (confirmed in Pass 3, 2026-09-05); the scheme/destination line above works, and so does this target/SDK form:

```
xcodebuild -project "Marlin DVR TV.xcodeproj" -target "Marlin DVR TV" -sdk appletvsimulator -configuration Debug build
```

## What is built

The empty project — Pass 1 was plumbing. One app entry point (`Marlin_DVR_TVApp.swift`) and one `ContentView` showing the app name.

Pass 2 (server recon, `reports/2026-09-05-pass2-server-recon.md`) and Pass 3 (HLS client recon against `HLS-CLIENT-API.md`, `reports/2026-09-05-pass3-hls-client-recon.md`) are done; both were read-only and wrote reports only.

Pass 4 (`reports/2026-09-05-pass4-design-and-build-recon.md`) put the approved design into `design/`, recorded the design decisions, and mapped every in-scope screen to the server API and into build sweeps.

Pass 5 (sweep 1, `reports/2026-09-05-pass5-sweep1-foundation.md`, pushed after the owner's Home Theater test): the foundation — ATS exception, API client, models, DRM filter, image loader, client register/ping — plus the rail and Home.

Pass 6 (sweep 2, `reports/2026-09-05-pass6-sweep2-screens.md`, committed locally, push gated on the owner's Home Theater test): the read-only screens — On Now, Guide with the airing sheet, On Later, Recordings with show detail, Cameras. Buttons owned by later sweeps are drawn and inert.

## What is NOT built

The Player and playback sessions (sweep 3), every server write — recording, passes, library flags (sweep 4) — the resume store, and the future screens Favorites, Weather, Radio, Settings.

## Open questions

See the Open Questions sections of `reports/2026-09-05-pass2-server-recon.md` (server recon) and `reports/2026-09-05-pass3-hls-client-recon.md` (HLS client recon). Environment questions from Pass 1 are listed in `reports/2026-09-05-pass1-plumbing.md`.

## Next step

Sweep 3, the Player, per reports/2026-09-05-pass4-design-and-build-recon.md §4 and HLS-CLIENT-API.md.
